Inputs:\n Business Description of your business and the product or service you are selling.\n Target Customer Profile The B2B customer profile you are targeting (industry, company size, role, etc.).\n Recipient Information Provide any available details about the person or company you are emailing to enable personalization (e.g., recent events , pain points ).\nEmail Properties: Concise The email should be short and to the point. It should be at max\n120 words. Ideally should be very short , 70 words. Be very careful of this.\nClear Communication The message should be easy to understand, avoiding jargon and complex language.\nRelevance Ensure the content is directly relevant to the recipientʼs needs and interests.\nIt should be understandable by a 4th grader. It should be so simple to read and the logic and words used should be so straightforward. Here, you can still talk about the details etc. However, the logic and value and problems etc should be conveyed in very simple framing. This is also another thing to anlayse after writing the mail.\nStructure of Email :\nAI Messager\n2\nSubject Line A short, intriguing subject line . Greeting Address the recipient by name. For eg: Hi George\nIntro A brief introduction that grabs attention. If you find a good way to personalise, Personalise the intro.\nEmail Body Explained further below Call to Action A clear and straightforward Call to action. Closing\nI have given details on guidelines, Templates and very good expert examples of emails. Follow their language.\nIdeal Workflow and Output -\nWrite an answer all the questions which will help you further clarify - Then Craft an email , Write the email Then Analyse the email , With all the info you have and tell all the good and bad things about it. Then craft a refined version of the email where you optimise as described below in details\nBelow are the details on how to do each part -\nBelow are all the important questions to answer first in your output.\nTo craft a great cold email. First you have to answer these questions. - Although if something is not clear, Leave it out. Try to answer most of these questions . The answer should be just a small description.\n What do you do? This should come from the descriptions and data about the business. You can also imagine possible benefits of this. There maybe multiple benefits, State them seperately .\nAI Messager\n3\n What does that solve? What is a specific problem does this solve? Or What value does this add ?\n How would they describe those problems? What is a good way to communicate these problems? How would they talk about it ?\n Is there a way they approaching that problem now?\n What indicates that problem exists? Are there any evidences ? These maynot be clear in which cases, You can leave it blank.\nHave clear spacing between long lines.\nPeople sift through emails and dont read all the lines with equal weight. It should also be easy to read for them. So ensure you dont send paragraphs. Send lines or two lines with one spacing then to the next sentence.\nIdentifying the Problem -\nWhen you are reaching out to other companies or potential customers for sales, you will face one of three completely different scenarios:\nThe prospect already knows about the problem that you can solve. This is the best example of ‘being in the right place at the right timeʼ! Unfortunately, it doesnʼt happen very often so donʼt get used to it.\nThe prospect knows that they have a huge problem, but they are already working with one of your competitors to solve it. This means that, in order to use your product or service, the prospect has to fire someone.\nThe prospect doesnʼt even know that they have a problem.\nMore often than not, you will face the second and third scenarios. That is why it is so important to do your research, make sure that your product or service answers a real and actual need, and be able to communicate this clearly to the prospect\nWhat Value do you add ? What are you selling ?\nAlleviate your audienceʼs pain or give them something they want. Why should the recipient care about your email? Why should this busy person take time to respond to it? Whatʼs in it for them?\nRemember that people will go much further to avoid pain than to acquire pleasure. If youʼve done your research and found a major pain point for the recipient, and you can offer relief, highlight that. Consider this example: A VC friend of mine once complained on Twitter about how his car was constantly getting tickets because the street signs were misleading. An entrepreneur looking to pitch his start-up started his cold email with a link to a robo-calling service that took care of parking tickets. The VC used the service and was so thankful that he not only took a pitch meeting but also connected the entrepreneur to several other VCs, two of whom ended up investing.\nIf you canʼt solve a problem, give people something they want. Offer to connect them with someone theyʼd like to meet — that stands out, since almost no one gives before they ask. But your gift needs to feel appropriate, from one stranger to another. An Amazon gift card would be super awkward and weird. I know, because someone sent one to me once.\nFocus on benefits, not features-\nDonʼt rely on a list of product features. Stop yourself from writing about the monetary value you offer. Instead only highlight the benefits your prospect may gain from it. Remember to be specific, since vague benefits will dilute your message.\nIt may be tricky at first, but when you really put yourself into the customerʼs shoes, youʼll feel it. Hereʼs some advice on how to change the perspective with examples:Features vs Benefits  How to Present Your Product in a Cold Email? \nYour pitch should also be seamlessly linked to the previous part of your email. It should seem just like a natural continuation of an ordinary conversation. By all means, avoid making it forced and salesy.\nAvoid salesy pitches\nAI Messager\n4\nIn a B2B sales email, we have to be subtle with our pitch. We donʼt write it to close one more sale. We write it to start a unique business relationship with a potential buyer. And that calls for a personal approach.\nAlways put your prospects in the center of your pitch. Provide as much value to them as you can. Find out what problems they may face that you can help them with. Use storytelling to show them how you might relieve them of those problems. Prove to them that youʼre here to help and learn.\nCold EmaIl intro -\nwhat should a cold email introduction look like?\nA cold email introduction shouldnʼt be longer than 23 sentences. Itʼs not supposed to introduce you or your company to the prospect. Instead, it refers to the message receiver, their expertise, achievements, work, and their company. Thatʼs how we catch their attention.\nA hint of flattery may be the way to go. But donʼt overdo it. Listing all of their recent activity is a step too far.\nStay in the professional field and keep everything focused on the business reasons for your interest in reaching out to them.\nYou may also use those few sentences of cold email introduction to make it a part where you ask about their problems. Or better, you can talk about the ones youʼve noticed they have that you can take care of.\nAbove all else, treat the introduction as an opportunity to show your prospects that they received the message because you chose to contact them specifically. Youʼve done your homework. You didnʼt decide to reach out to them on a whim. You were deliberate about it.\nGrab the attention with a personal opening line\nYou have about 3 seconds to capture the attention of the recipient, so don't start with \"I hope this email finds you well!\". Instead, think about what you've learned about them and come up with something personal that\nAI Messager\n5\nAI Messager\n6\ndirectly relates to the subject matter.\nSometimes it's hard to come up with something that shows that you got to know the recipient. Try complimenting their recent work you came across, lead with a question that sets up the stage for your value proposition or consider skipping the opening line altogether. It's better to go straight to the business than waste their time with something irrelevant.\nSome Templates for the email body -\nThe “PASˮ cold email template\nThe \"PAS\" cold email template is a three-part formula: Problem -\nIdentify a problem specific to the customer you're cold emailing. Twitter, Google, Yelp, Facebook, and other user-driven sites are ideal for pinpointing a problem your recipient may be struggling with.\nAgitate Now that you've identified the problem, poke at it a little. Try and evoke an emotional response from the reader by reinforcing why their problem is so frustrating.\nSolve Offer a solution to the problem. The goal is to convince the reader that your product/service is a no-brainer solution that makes all their problems go away. Make sure this section includes a clear and low- commitment CTA.\nThe template below is designed for a salesperson selling a CRM solution, but it can be easily modified for other products.\nTemplate - Hi {first name},\nAI Messager\n7\nI've noticed some negative reviews about your customer service. Citing lost tickets, lack of tools, and disorganization. Isʼt this frustrating ?\nProduct name} integrates all customer data. You can easily track, manage, and measure customer interactions.\nWould you like to hear more about how {product name} can turn those negative reviews into loyal, satisfied customers?\nEnding\nWhy Does this work ?\nThe opening line of this email example is personalized and shows the reader youʼve done your research. More importantly, pointing out a flaw or problem your reader has is highly motivating. They donʼt want others to know their companyʼs weaknesses, which is why the PAS formula has such a high response rate. Your reader will be desperate to fix the problem, and theyʼll have an easy solution right in front of them.\nWhen to use it ?\nMake sure youʼve done your research before using a PAS email. Itʼs most effective once youʼve clearly identified a prospectʼs pain point to which you can offer a no-brainer solution in response.\nThe “AIDAˮ cold email template\nSocial proof, data, and intrigue are what make the AIDA (attention, interest, desire, action) formula successful. Itʼs kind of like being that friend who talks to you after a rough day at work and says, “Hey, I totally get it.ˮ\nLetʼs look at an example of a cold email using the AIDA template backed by real data.\nAI Messager\n8\nTemplate -\nHi {first name}, What if a {product/service} could help you {solve a problem} ?\nIn one year's time, we helped {company name] achieve a % increase in sales after implementing your {product name}.\nIn addition to an increase in sales, {your product name} helped {company name} improve their overall workflow, increase efficiency, reduce response rate time, and improve customer satisfaction from A% to B%.\nI'd love to talk to you about how your product name could help your company increase sales and improve workflow. Do you have time to connect this week?\nWhy Does this work ?\nThe data and social proof you provide in your message should be relevant to your cold email prospect. If your prospect is part of a company that sells SEO metrics software, for example, your use case should reflect a similar brand model.\nThe opening line should intrigue your lead with a thought-provoking and attractive scenario (attention). The second line is designed to keep the reader interested by offering a tidbit of social proof or data that supports your opening statement (interest).\nNext, pique your lead's desire by offering even more social proof (desire). The \"attention.\" \"interest.\" and \"desire\" parts of AIDA will keep your reader hooked throughout the email. After you get your reader to say, \"Okay, I'm convinced.\" the last piece of the formula (action) should address the question \"What do I do next?\"\nWhen to use it ?\nUse the AIDA approach when your cold email prospect represents a data-\nAI Messager\n9\ndriven brand because they'll be interested in the data and social proof. Find out what's important to your prospect on a professional level. If your product or service is a match for that\nprospect, presenting attractive data from a successful use case will motivate your reader to respond.\nThe “straight to businessˮ cold email template\nSometimes the direct approach is the best approach. This is especially true for busy executives and no-nonsense brands. Get right to the point by identifying a scenario or problem common to your prospect. Without any added fluff, present the reader with concrete data that proves your product or service is the logical solution.\nWhile the template below is specific to a CRM solution, it can be tweaked for any type of organization.\nTemplate -\nHi {first name}, Is your customer support system actually losing you money?\nWeʼve helped large companies like yours lower support costs by {x%} and improve overall sales by {xy%} in less than a year.\nAll we did was integrate their entire company-wide support system into one efficient, easy-to-manage workflow called {product/service name}.\nItʼs quick and easy to set up and requires no onboarding at all. Do you have time this week to discuss how {product/service name} could boost your sales?\nWhy Does this work ?\nAI Messager\n10\nThe opening line is the perfect intro hook for a busy prospect: short, attention-grabbing, and engaging.\nIn this case, the cold email caters specifically to the no-nonsense mind of your prospect. You get straight to the point, provide proof, and leave your prospect with a low-commitment CTA that fits their schedule.\nWhen to use it ?\nThis approach is highly effective for eliciting responses from busy professionals with flooded inboxes. It quickly answers the question, “Whatʼs in it for me?ˮ and provides proof to back it up.\nThe “paint a pictureˮ cold email template\nThis cold email is all about getting your potential prospect to visualize how sweet life could be with your product or service.\nConvince a prospect that your product or service will directly improve their world by showing them what their life currently looks like without it. Make sure whatever scenario you present is realistic to your prospect.\nNext, paint a picture of that same scenario, only this time with your product or service. Whatʼs changed? How has your solution made their life so much better?\nTemplate-\nHi {first name},\nNothing is more frustrating than losing a great candidate because you canʼt find their resume, interview history, or contact information.\nImagine a world where all of that information is organized in one simple, easy-to-find place. Product/service name} is that place.\nDo you have time this week for a quick demo to see how it works? {insert email signature here}\nWhy Does this work ?\nThe “paint a pictureˮ cold sales email template is a shortcut to getting your prospect to convert as quickly as possible. If they can envision a better, easier, or more productive life with your product or service, theyʼll only have one question left: “Where do I sign up?ˮ. For very well envisionble things, this is great. Can also be used in mixture with the other templates.\nWhen to use it ?\nCold emails are only effective if the product or service youʼre presenting makes sense to the reader. They need to know how it will directly benefit them.\nSome people may have a harder time understanding how your product or service works in a practical sense. This cold email answers that question with a real-world example that every brand should have in its arsenal.\nSome Frameworks - How to Use These Frameworks\nEach framework is built for designated use cases. This helps identify where theyʼll be the most effective for you. We include examples for each framework, but these are not meant to be copy and pasted. They only contain light personalization, so the framework bones are clear. Use these as the key elements of your email and build upon them.\nYour emails should contain more personalization than the examples to make sure they resonate. Focus on the frameworksʼ underlying structure and\nAI Messager\n11\ninstructions.\nTake a framework and make it your own. Then, plug it into Lavender and see how it scores. Our email coach will identify what needs to be fixed and how to edit your email to optimize for a 90 score. Emails that score 90 or above have double the chance of getting a reply.\nNot using Lavender it? We help thousands of sellers worldwide send better emails faster—and feel confident while improving. Try it today for free.\nThe Mouse Trap Use case: First touch, DM, Follow-up How to use it: The Mouse Trap contains two steps. And itʼs a one or two-sentence email. 1. Observation 2. Question\nAn observation is the context for why youʼre showing up in their inbox. The question should be value-prop driven, meaning the value you add. It focuses on a challenge and implies your product or service has the solution.\nThe question should be binary (meaning it can be answered with a yes or no), and it doesnʼt explicitly state what you do. The question is phrased so it implies what you do.\nExample:\nWill, looks like you're hiring reps.\nWould it be helpful to get a more granular look at how they're ramping up on email?\nWhy it works: The mouse trap drives an impulsive reply based on curiosity. Itʼs a priority check. If what youʼre mentioning is a priority for your prospect, youʼre likely to get a quick response.\nItʼs a helpful framework to use when you have high-intent signals or are in demand capture mode.\nThe Mouse Trap with Context Use case: First touch, DM, Follow-up\nAI Messager\n12\nHow to use it:\n1. Observation 2. Question 3. Context\nThis is the same as The Mouse Trap, but also includes context for what you do. You want to hit on an implied solution to the challenge. Youʼre providing a little more background information for why youʼre reaching out.\nExample:\nWill, looks like you're hiring reps.\nWould it be helpful to get a more granular look at how they're ramping on email? Our in-inbox email coach, Lavender, helps teams ramp faster.\nWhy it works: Youʼre taking The Mouse Trap and adding how you can help your reader if the suggested problem is present. This added detail can bring them closer to understanding the purpose of your question.\nItʼs still short and direct, which is why it also works as a direct message DM or as a bump (a follow-up email).\nVanilla Ice Cream\nUse case: First touch\nHow to use it:\n1. Make an observation: One sentence that shows you know your reader. Use your personalization research.\n2. Share a problem or insight: One relevant sentence that implies a pain point or value prop. It should be related to your observation.\n3. Build credibility: Speak to the challenge youʼre solving and how youʼve helped solve this for other customers.\n4. Share a solution: Explain what you did to solve this problem in one sentence.\n5. Call-to-conversation CTC End with a question or interest-based CTA (call to action). Your primary goal is to start a conversation.\nExample:\nGeorge,\nAI Messager\n13\nAI Messager\n14\nI saw you're hiring SDRs. I imagine you're thinking about how they'll ramp. Usually, our customers focus on cold calls. But their email results lag.\nWe're helping reps at Sendoso ramp faster. They continue to improve each quarter with our in-inbox coach.\nWorth a chat? Will\nWhy this works: The first part of the email creates logic and clarity for why youʼre reaching out. Making an informed conclusion from an observation shows you understand the situation they may be in. This builds credibility.\nThe second half gives the email purpose. It establishes the context and illustrates to the reader that you know them.\nAnd lastly, think of your prospecting as growing a plant. In order to grow, a plant needs nurturing and the right conditions. Similarly, with your first touch, you're planting a seed and beginning to build rapport.\nSo donʼt pitch your product at this point. Your aim is to get a reply, not book a meeting (yet). Booking a meeting and closing a deal will come after you get a positive reply. So focus there first!\nWe call this one Vanilla Ice Cream because itʼs foundational. Like a delicious sundae may have a vanilla ice cream base, this framework is the base for your fantastic emails.\n2x your reply rates with Lavender\nNeutral Insights Use case: Follow up, LinkedIn DMs, nurture or re-engagement How to use it:\n1. Reference a third-party resource: Bring a trusted, third-party publication to the discussion. Share the piece you want your reader to see, and show that youʼre being neutral. Do not use your companyʼs blog or other branded resources.\n2. Explain why they should read it: Reuse your context for reaching out and start a conversation with this question.\nAI Messager\n15\n3. Explain why youʼre sharing it: Tie your “whyˮ to your understanding of their situation and their business needs, wants, and goals.\n4. Optional: Make a soft ask and nod back to the original CTA or, ideally, CTC.\nExample:\nGeorge, do you read Outreachʼs blog? Given you're likely ramping reps, I thought you'd find it interesting.\nThe VP of Sales Dev at Segment wrote about how she scaled her team to a $3.2B acquisition.\nThey did it without using canned templates (and using Lavender! Check it out Will P.S. Any thoughts on my last note?\nWhy this works: Your reader knows youʼre trying to sell something. Most people send their own branded content. However, your companyʼs content tends to be biased — at least, thatʼs your buyerʼs perception.\nBy sending them a third-party resource, youʼre breaking a pattern. Youʼre building trust on common, neutral ground. This approach creates a sense of safety. And it also keeps your reader engaged.\nSending relevant content that could help your reader builds connection as a trusted resource. And thatʼs a prerequisite for any next steps.\nThe Thoughtful Bump Use case: Follow up How to use it: Context  Bump\nThis email should be one to three sentences. First, ask if your reader had thoughts on your previous message. Explain youʼre curious because of the original reason you reached out. End with a simple question.\nExample:\nHey George,\nAI Messager\n16\nGiven that you're growing the sales team, I thought this would be worth discussing.\nDid you have any feedback on my note? Will\nWhy it works: With this framework, youʼre still seeking to start a conversation. Youʼre being thoughtful by providing context for why you are reaching out. Youʼre showing youʼve considered their time and value their attention by asking a casual question in this “bumpˮ format.\nGenuine curiosity can both hook the reader and ensure youʼre being human in your approach.\nThe Clarification Use case: Follow up How to use it: Rephrase The Vanilla Ice Cream framework with these changes: 1. Restate the context for why youʼre reaching out\n2. Seek to clarify part 1 \"What we do\"\n3. Seek to clarify part 2 \"Why that's relevantˮ\n4. Call-to-conversation CTC\nExample:\nHey George,\nGiven you're growing the sales team, I thought coaching might be top of mind.\nTo clarify, we've built a sales email coach. Sits right inside their inbox.\nHigh-growth teams like Twilio get great results (and peace of mind). Plus, you get a better sense of what reps are sending without hovering over their shoulder.\nThink this could help your team? Will\nWhy it works: This is another version of a Thoughtful Bump. It rephrases the original first-touch framework.\nAI Messager\n17\nThe added context gives you a shot to clarify exactly where your solution applies to their challenge. This email is not a place to feature dump. Instead, itʼs an opportunity to explain how your solution fits into their life. It makes things concrete for the reader.\nIf an email is too focused on you or your company, itʼs not a great cold email. But itʼs a great follow-up email because youʼve already introduced the problem into their mind, and now youʼre providing clarity on how you can give them a solution.\nThe Well-Researched Referral Use case: Follow Up How to use it: 1. Start with who (namedrop early)\n2. Ask if they're a better person for the topic\n3. Explain why they might be a better person.\n4. Explain why you reached out in the first place.\nExample:\nHey Will,\nWould Jen be a better person to talk to about this webinar?\nRealize she manages community activity. Given the event is going to be all sellers, I thought you'd want the exposure.\nWill\nWhy it works: When you havenʼt heard back, or you receive a “not interested,ˮ this framework can be a powerful tool. At this stage, youʼre not selling; youʼre soliciting. The key is to be well-researched. Otherwise, your reader will see right through it.\nDo your research, and donʼt just drop a name — have a reason for why this other person could be the better one to connect with. Example: Plug this new personʼs experience, or mention the roles and responsibilities from their LinkedIn description.\nYou can also try this as a P.S. in your follow-up email. Our data shows that a P.S. on a personalized note can net 35% more replies.\nAdding something like, “P.S. If this is something Jen is handling, I can reach out to herˮ can be an effective way to drive that referral forward.\nPro tip: Donʼt dump the same email on two people at the same company simultaneously. They are very likely to backchannel to each other. If they find youʼre sending the same email to multiple people, theyʼre unlikely to respond positively.\nThis approach can also cause deliverability issues. You might get flagged for spamming or, if done too often, blacklisted.\nThe Breakup Use case: Objection, breakup/final email How to use it: 1. State that you've reached out 2. Explain why you did 3. Assume the timing is off 4. Ask them to correct you 5. Clarify it's the last email Example: Hey George, I've reached out a few times because youʼre hiring so many new reps. I thought our email coach could help.\nAI Messager\n18\nAI Messager\n19\nI'm going to chalk it up to my timing being off. Let me know if I'm wrong, but I'll stop my outreach for now. Do you think this will be a priority in the next two quarters?\nWhy it works: Remember itʼs not a breakup forever; itʼs a “bye for now.ˮ Youʼre not saying youʼll never talk to them again. But if youʼve sent a few notes and havenʼt heard back, ask if you “missed the markˮ and try to get them to correct you. People love to correct others.\nThe Competitor\n(or Complementary Tech) Use case: First touch How to use it: 1. Acknowledge the competitor 2. Ask if they're happy with it 3. Compliment the competitor 4. Highlight the competitor's shortcomings 5. Open up a dialogue with a question related to #4 Example:\nHey Will, Saw you're using Drift for chat. How are you liking it?\nI know their product is killer for lead gen. However, most of their customers switch to us because they need more functionality for customer support.\nCould you see chat playing a factor in reducing churn?\nWhy this works: Discussing the competitor's shortcomings helps reframe your readerʼs point of view. Notice how the exampleʼs second and third sentence reframes, establishes credibility, and creates a bridge to the next point. This can be an opportunity to get specific and build personalization.\nYouʼre seeking to get a deeper understanding during the fifth step. If someoneʼs primary concern is the competitorʼs strength, itʼs hard to change their mind. You need to know more. This deeper understanding can also help you prioritize your time on deals.\nAI Messager\n20\nWhile you should avoid badmouthing your competition, it can be useful to highlight your strengths.\nPro tip: Tie the differences you highlight to your readerʼs situation and problems.\nThe Video\nUse case: Prospecting (but never in a first touch)\nHow to use it:\n1. Observation (to give context)\n2. Tie the observation to their challenge\nA video should never be your first touch. It gives the reader extra work and can hurt your chances of delivery.\nThe video also canʼt stand alone. You need to give your prospect an idea of whatʼs in the video and compel them to want to watch it.\nAs a seller, you must put yourself in a decision makerʼs shoes. Theyʼre in meetings and calls all day. They simply canʼt watch your video (or listen to your audio message) during a meeting. An email is much easier to read when theyʼre multitasking.\nSome buyers will never watch your video. Others love to receive them. Itʼs important to test multiple formats and channels on each buyer. But never start off with a video because itʼs unlikely to be watched or responded to. First, build familiarity via text.\nExample:\nHey Will,\nGiven your team is growing, I thought you'd find this interesting. Growth typically either leads to one of two things: trying to standardize or risking having no idea whatʼs working across inboxes.\nAssuming youʼre personalizing emails, thought you might enjoy this: [insert video here]\nIf so, worth a chat soon?\nWhy this works: When youʼre sending a video, your only goal is a video play. Like other frameworks, you need to start with context and connect it\nto a potential problem your prospect is facing. This is a common theme because selling is about solving your buyer's pain.\nFinally, end with an ask to continue the conversation. Here are other powerful ways to incorporate video in your emails.\nThe DM\nUse case: LinkedIn InMail / DM (or other social platforms)\nHow to use it:\n1. Give context on what prompted you to reach out\n2. Tie that observation back to an insight or challenge they have\n3. Ask a question that either ties the original context to the question or the challenge to a different observation about them or their business\nExample:\nHey Emily,\nGreat to see the traction on your hiring post. For SDR ramp, Iʼm seeing a lot of sales leaders leaning on phone training and email templates.Do you have a playbook from your time with Salesforce?\nWill\nWhy it works: Social inboxes arenʼt email inboxes. Itʼs a water cooler. Not a to-do list. This framework takes best practices from email and applies them to social.\nYouʼll notice itʼs shorter and focused on starting a controlled dialogue where you can naturally introduce what you do. It pulls in personalization at the bottom of the message (not just the top).\nSeek to start a conversation: Try to give the reader context on why youʼre showing up in their DMs.\nHere are a few other tips and tactics to remember when crafting your next LinkedIn InMail or other social media DM.\nFounder Card Use case: Founder-led sales, Entering a new market, Launching a new\nproduct\nHow to use it:\nAI Messager\n21\n1. Start with a problem and a benign goal\n2. State that youʼre looking for feedback\n3. Say what you do and establish credibility\n4. Share what you want feedback on and ask if they're open to the conversation\nExample:\nWill, is anything frustrating you with your email analytics?\nI ask because I'm looking for feedback. I run Lavender. It's a real-time sales email coach. We help sellers at orgs like Sendoso, Twilio, Clari, etc.\nWe're currently building out cadences and personalization analytics. Are you open to sharing how we could build it to solve your problems? Talk soon.\nWhy it works: This framework can set you up to get feedback and find product market fit. People will likely give you helpful feedback if you've hit the mark with the problem.\nThis only works if youʼre clear on why you want their feedback and think it can help them. Youʼre telling your reader you have influence in the company, and you can make the product fit their specific needs.\nToe Dip\nUse case: Conversation starter\nHow to use it:\n1. Observation\n2. Interest-based CTC (call-to-conversation)\nExample:\nLooks like you're hiring reps, Will.\nSales leaders with growing teams usually lean on templates to coach email writing.\nDoes that sound similar to what you're doing at Lavender?\nWhy it works: All first-touch emails seek to start a conversation. But this is a simple and brief way to do that.\nAI Messager\n22\nAI Messager\n23\nRe-Engage 3 Ways Use case: Re-engage old accounts How to use it: We have three different approaches that are effective for re-engagement.\nA common theme youʼll see in each framework is using unsure tones. Because youʼre showing up in your buyerʼs inbox again and attempting to revive a convo, everything you say should be assumption-free.\n1. One sentence re-engagement email:\nIs XYZ still a priority? Is challenge still a priority? Are you still working on <initiative to achieve outcome>? Last we spoke X problem] was a focus. Is that still top of mind?\nWhy this works: Itʼs important to be mindful of how much time youʼre requesting from your recipient. Especially when youʼre attempting to re- engage and have shown up in their inbox. Thatʼs why a one-sentence email can be highly effective.\nThis approach helps you get to the point with a straightforward question. Because itʼs brief and conversational, they may be more likely to respond with a simple answer, giving you something to work with for a follow-up.\nPS. This approach is also great for when youʼve been ghosted (not only for re-engagement).\n2. The “We've got something newˮ angle\nRemind your recipient of context from previous conversations (in one sentence).\nUpdate them about what's new since you spoke. This should be something that could help them achieve the outcome they said they were interested in.\nAsk if it's worth re-engaging.\nExample:\nHey Meagan, Last we spoke, personalization was a big focus for your reps.\nNot sure if that's still the case, but we made some great updates to our personalization assistant. Itʼs now 10x faster.\nThink this could help? Or is this no longer a focus?\nWhy this works: First, youʼre restating something familiar from a previous conversation. Hopefully, this triggers a memory for them; at the least, youʼre reinforcing your thoughtfulness.\nYouʼre then directly connecting a product update to their need. This may or may not be enough for them to have interest, but youʼre closing with the open ask. Youʼre simply seeking to start a conversation (again) and not assuming itʼs of interest.\n3. New updates on their end:\nRemind your recipient of context from previous conversations (in one sentence).\nState what you've observed change. Remember to be tentative, donʼt make assumptions.)\nShare how you think priorities may have changed and how your company aligns.\nConfirm if your hypothesis is accurate.\nExample:\nHey Sam, Last time we spoke, getting your AEs to prospect was a big focus.\nNow that you're hiring SDRs, I wonder if that means the AEs werenʼt successful?\nOur dashboards can help you get ahead of these coachable moments. Itʼll give you data on writing time, content analytics, where to improve, personalization, etc.\nAm I off in thinking you'd like a deeper sense of what's working in your email efforts?\nWhy this works: This is similar to the last approach. However, here youʼre making a connection between a change or update in their company and how you might be able to help.\nAI Messager\n24\nAI Messager\n25\nItʼs easy to be off-base when making an observation, so using unsure tones is critical. Best case, your observation lands correctly. Worst case, they set you straight, and you have a reply to work with.\nExec-to-Exec\nUse case: Late-stage deal or when youʼve been ghosted\nHow to use it:\nExecutives donʼt have a lot of time. This email should be short and direct.\n1. Explain why youʼre showing up in their inbox.\n2. Reinforce that your team is aligned on the problem you aim to solve for the recipient.\n3. Close by offering your support.\nExample:\nJen,\nI understand youʼve been working with Ashley on our team in hopes Lavender can solve your challenge with diving reply rates.\nIs there anything we can do to assist you here? Cheers, Will\nWhy it works: Think of this framework as a nudge. Sometimes, all it takes is someone with a similar title as your decision-maker to help move the conversation. Thereʼs no ask happening here. By showing up and simply offering to help, youʼre creating a connection with another stakeholder with zero pressure.\nThe Customer Mirror How to use it: 1. Start with an observation. Avoid any “I sawˮ or “I noticedˮ narratives.\n2. Tie the observation to a similar situation. This is where you loop in your customer. The customerʼs similarity is your reason for reaching out. Make sure you know who youʼre reaching out to.\n3. Offer a challenge faced by that customer. Youʼre creating relatability.\nAI Messager\n26\n4. Explain how the customer approached the challenge. Explain how they were dealing with the problem. Nail these two sections of copy and watch your reply rates .\n5. Ask if theyʼre seeing a similar situation. Great opportunity to either sandwich the email with new personalization or reuse your original observation.\nPro tip: Bringing in something new? Use their work experience. Shapes their perspective.\nExample:\nYour team is off to the races, Will.\nCurious if this sounds familiar. With the round, and your time at [company], it reminds me of our customer [name].\nBig round. New faces. Team knew personalization was working in outbound. But scale was tricky. They lost sight of what was working.\nPersonalization is big at [company name], no? Curious if this is a challenge for you too?\nWhy it works: Thereʼs no pitch involved in this email. Itʼs nothing more than sharing a story your buyer can relate to.\nWe donʼt want to overwhelm the reader. Itʼs already a longer framework. Save the finale for a follow-up. See our follow-up frameworks above. :)\nSocial Proof\nIf possible Offer some social proof. Add a couple of customer reviews, testimonials, and case studies from some of your former clients. If you have an online profile, you can also direct prospects to some of your best work. This is a great way to show them that youʼre a professional who knows what they are doing.\nTailor the message to the recipient , Validating you in relation to them-\n📈\nPersonalization means that youʼve thought about who this person is, how they see the world, what interests them, and what they want — youʼve developed a “theory of mindˮ about the recipient. This shows them you have put work into understanding them.\nYou also make it clear why you are emailing them as opposed to anyone else. Research shows that people are far more motivated to help others when they feel uniquely qualified to do so. By outlining precisely where they fit in, you can tell a story that makes sense to them.\nIf possible, Validate yourself. When we meet a stranger or get an email from one, we want to know who that person is and why that person matters to us.\nRemember that when youʼre the stranger. Youʼve already done a bunch of research on the people youʼre emailing, but they donʼt know anything about you. You need to show them youʼre credible and they can trust you.\nKnowing someone in common is the strongest form of social proof you can offer. If you have any direct connections, mention them. A mutual friend means you are no longer a stranger.\nLacking that, if you have any authority, credibility, or social status that is relevant to this person and your request, mention it quickly — a line or two should do it. The more “importantˮ you are, the more likely you are to get a response.\nIf you have no real status, thatʼs fine. Find a commonality. Being part of the same group, especially if itʼs a personal group, is a core human attraction. Look for unexpected connections, like hometowns and unusual hobbies. As Adam Grant points out, “Similarities matter most when theyʼre rare. We bond when we share uncommon commonalities, which allow us to feel that we fit in and stand out at the same time.ˮ\nThe point is, you want to find a way to go from “strangerˮ to part of the recipientʼs group\nCTA\nAI Messager\n27\nEvery email has a purpose, whether thatʼs asking for information, calling for a click, or asking for a reply Or asking them to share more info or any Clear action which will result in the person replying and potentially buying what you sell. Getting the right call to action is critical for a successful cold email campaign.\nEnd your cold email with a call-to-action\nYouʼre almost done. You just need to write a call to action CTA that will persuade your prospects to do what you ultimately want them to do with your cold email. It may be scheduling a Zoom conversation, giving you feedback, replying to you, etc. Anything youʼre ready to take care of. Any action you ultimately want them to perform. Keep it simple and straightforward.\nTo make sure your recipients will take action, your CTA should:\nExpress the purpose of your email – the CTA should clarify the aim of your email in a single sentence. To put it differently, it should clearly show the addressee what you want them to do.\nBe short and to-the-point – the CTA shouldnʼt take more than a single sentence. You should be as succinct as you can. It shouldnʼt be blurry either\nHow to craft a Subject ?\nThe Subject has to very minimal words. 3 or 4 words is ideal.\nA cold email subject line could be seen as the key that unlocks the door to our message. Our prospects form their first impression of us while reading the subject line. Thatʼs why we need to make it a good one.\nA poorly written subject line may make the addressee biased against us and our email. They might decide not to open the email, or worse, manually mark it as spam which may cause problems with email deliverability.\nWe can avoid such situations so long as we stick to these rules:\nAI Messager\n28\nAI Messager\n29\nconsider your prospect‘s point of view – think what kind of benefit your subject line promises to the prospect. Whatʼs in it for them after opening your email? Does it answer their needs or appeals to their curiosity? Make it about them, not about you.\npersonalize it – again, the subject line isnʼt a place for self-promotion. Quite the opposite, itʼs a place where you should prove to the addressee that you carefully planned to contact them. You should assure them youʼre not a spammer who sends tons of identical emails to people and waits to see what sticks.\nintrigue them – donʼt spill the beans just yet. Pique their interest. Engage their attention by making them reflect on a problem they may have. Or try using a little bit of flattery to catch their attention.\nsound human – youʼre writing to a living and breathing human being, and thus, you shouldnʼt turn into a bot. Avoid sounding ‘salesyʼ or too formal. Your subject line should have a casual, friendly and natural flair to it. Unless you know how to achieve this, try imagining youʼre addressing a specific person you know, for example, your colleague.\ntie it to the rest of the email – this relates to the earlier points discussed. Itʼs crucial to ensure that your subject line aligns with the content of your message. Avoid resorting to clickbait strategies in your subject line, as they will only irritate your prospects and negatively impact your outreach efforts.\nAvoid Cliches and jargon\nPeople tend to sift through emails and this cliches like “Found that “ and “Strategicˮ . Remove cliches like ˮHope this email finds you well “ ˮInnovativeˮ AI Recruiter . Remove “Comprehensiveˮ . Reduce # of syllables in words/sentences/paragraphs. Simpler emails tend to get more replies.\nPersonalisation\nAI Messager\n30\nOne idea rule of emails . Max 2. The one-idea rule is this:\nOne idea per email One idea per paragraph One idea per sentence\nThe one-idea rule makes it easy to write clearly. And clarity is the primary focus when writing emails.\nCommas conjoin ideas. They break the one-idea rule. And if your sentence is long enough to require a breath (a comma), it's likely too long and unclear for email. If you're using a comma, the two ideas can likely exist as two individual sentences. Writing this way might seem too simple or too choppy. If it does, you're right on track.\nThis is because people don't read emails. They skim them. Litmus research shows that users spend an average of 9 seconds with your emails. Short, choppy sentences are easier to skim.\nOptimised Email -\nYou have to optimise the earlier draft on two things - 1. Remember to output as small an email as possible . Cut down words , Cut down unnecessary descriptions and cliches , Cut down words which are not necessary.

I doubt I'd be a huge client for them so is that time well spent?\nThey could spot I have a new merch store & hold multiple roles in less than 5-minutes, that's probably enough to hypothesize that I'm a busy dude and don't like doing fulfillment.\nThe problem isn't super clear, I have to assume they're saying \"fulfillment is a pain, we can help with that\"\nThe solution is a bit buzz-wordy, I don't know what 3PL is and don't really care\nHere's a rewrite that could've been less personalized but still nailed it:\n\"Hey Will,\nYour new merch store looks incredible.

Put at least one rep on a Kixie trial for free for one week 2. If his/her number of calls and pickup rate don't increase, Chipotle on me (quac and double chicken)\nGame on?\nExpert Opinion -\nShoutout to Roy Lieberman at Kixie for an awesome email. \"i will buy you chipotle\" is a great subject, definitely piques my curiosity (even though we don't have Chipotle in Quebec) Starts with a reference to the Linked live event and then makes an assumption from there about power dialers. This is a touch risky, since, I register for a bunch of Linkedin lives and don't always attend them, but I was at this one for a bit. Finally - the \"piece de resistance\" - putting your money where your mouth is and offering up a free trial to SHOW the possible results of the tool. The ironic part is I have no interest in a power dialer right now, nor do I have Chipotle in my area, but I still loved the message. Great job Roy. Fun. Creative. Different"

It should be at max\n120 words. Ideally should be very short , 70 words. Be very careful of this.\nClear Communication The message should be easy to understand, avoiding jargon and complex language.\nRelevance Ensure the content is directly relevant to the recipientʼs needs and interests.\nIt should be understandable by a 4th grader. It should be so simple to read and the logic and words used should be so straightforward. Here, you can still talk about the details etc. However, the logic and value and problems etc should be conveyed in very simple framing. This is also another thing to anlayse after writing the mail.\nStructure of Email :\nAI Messager\n2\nSubject Line A short, intriguing subject line . Greeting Address the recipient by name. For eg: Hi George\nIntro A brief introduction that grabs attention. If you find a good way to personalise, Personalise the intro.\nEmail Body Explained further below Call to Action A clear and straightforward Call to action. Closing\nI have given details on guidelines, Templates and very good expert examples of emails. Follow their language.\nIdeal Workflow and Output -\nWrite an answer all the questions which will help you further clarify - Then Craft an email , Write the email Then Analyse the email , With all the info you have and tell all the good and bad things about it. Then craft a refined version of the email where you optimise as described below in details\nBelow are the details on how to do each part -\nBelow are all the important questions to answer first in your output.\nTo craft a great cold email. First you have to answer these questions. - Although if something is not clear, Leave it out. Try to answer most of these questions . The answer should be just a small description.\n What do you do? This should come from the descriptions and data about the business. You can also imagine possible benefits of this. There maybe multiple benefits, State them seperately .\nAI Messager\n3\n What does that solve? What is a specific problem does this solve? Or What value does this add ?\n How would they describe those problems? What is a good way to communicate these problems? How would they talk about it ?\n Is there a way they approaching that problem now?\n What indicates that problem exists? Are there any evidences ? These maynot be clear in which cases, You can leave it blank.\nHave clear spacing between long lines.\nPeople sift through emails and dont read all the lines with equal weight. It should also be easy to read for them. So ensure you dont send paragraphs. Send lines or two lines with one spacing then to the next sentence.\nIdentifying the Problem -\nWhen you are reaching out to other companies or potential customers for sales, you will face one of three completely different scenarios:\nThe prospect already knows about the problem that you can solve. This is the best example of ‘being in the right place at the right timeʼ! Unfortunately, it doesnʼt happen very often so donʼt get used to it.\nThe prospect knows that they have a huge problem, but they are already working with one of your competitors to solve it. This means that, in order to use your product or service, the prospect has to fire someone.\nThe prospect doesnʼt even know that they have a problem.\nMore often than not, you will face the second and third scenarios. That is why it is so important to do your research, make sure that your product or service answers a real and actual need, and be able to communicate this clearly to the prospect\nWhat Value do you add ? What are you selling ?\nAlleviate your audienceʼs pain or give them something they want. Why should the recipient care about your email? Why should this busy person take time to respond to it? Whatʼs in it for them?\nRemember that people will go much further to avoid pain than to acquire pleasure. If youʼve done your research and found a major pain point for the recipient, and you can offer relief, highlight that. Consider this example: A VC friend of mine once complained on Twitter about how his car was constantly getting tickets because the street signs were misleading. An entrepreneur looking to pitch his start-up started his cold email with a link to a robo-calling service that took care of parking tickets. The VC used the service and was so thankful that he not only took a pitch meeting but also connected the entrepreneur to several other VCs, two of whom ended up investing.\nIf you canʼt solve a problem, give people something they want. Offer to connect them with someone theyʼd like to meet — that stands out, since almost no one gives before they ask. But your gift needs to feel appropriate, from one stranger to another. An Amazon gift card would be super awkward and weird. I know, because someone sent one to me once.\nFocus on benefits, not features-\nDonʼt rely on a list of product features. Stop yourself from writing about the monetary value you offer. Instead only highlight the benefits your prospect may gain from it. Remember to be specific, since vague benefits will dilute your message.\nIt may be tricky at first, but when you really put yourself into the customerʼs shoes, youʼll feel it. Hereʼs some advice on how to change the perspective with examples:Features vs Benefits  How to Present Your Product in a Cold Email? \nYour pitch should also be seamlessly linked to the previous part of your email. It should seem just like a natural continuation of an ordinary conversation. By all means, avoid making it forced and salesy.\nAvoid salesy pitches\nAI Messager\n4\nIn a B2B sales email, we have to be subtle with our pitch. We donʼt write it to close one more sale. We write it to start a unique business relationship with a potential buyer. And that calls for a personal approach.\nAlways put your prospects in the center of your pitch. Provide as much value to them as you can. Find out what problems they may face that you can help them with. Use storytelling to show them how you might relieve them of those problems. Prove to them that youʼre here to help and learn.\nCold EmaIl intro -\nwhat should a cold email introduction look like?\nA cold email introduction shouldnʼt be longer than 23 sentences. Itʼs not supposed to introduce you or your company to the prospect. Instead, it refers to the message receiver, their expertise, achievements, work, and their company. Thatʼs how we catch their attention.\nA hint of flattery may be the way to go. But donʼt overdo it. Listing all of their recent activity is a step too far.\nStay in the professional field and keep everything focused on the business reasons for your interest in reaching out to them.\nYou may also use those few sentences of cold email introduction to make it a part where you ask about their problems. Or better, you can talk about the ones youʼve noticed they have that you can take care of.\nAbove all else, treat the introduction as an opportunity to show your prospects that they received the message because you chose to contact them specifically. Youʼve done your homework. You didnʼt decide to reach out to them on a whim. You were deliberate about it.\nGrab the attention with a personal opening line\nYou have about 3 seconds to capture the attention of the recipient, so don't start with \"I hope this email finds you well!\". Instead, think about what you've learned about them and come up with something personal that\nAI Messager\n5\nAI Messager\n6\ndirectly relates to the subject matter.\nSometimes it's hard to come up with something that shows that you got to know the recipient. Try complimenting their recent work you came across, lead with a question that sets up the stage for your value proposition or consider skipping the opening line altogether. It's better to go straight to the business than waste their time with something irrelevant.\nSome Templates for the email body -\nThe “PASˮ cold email template\nThe \"PAS\" cold email template is a three-part formula: Problem -\nIdentify a problem specific to the customer you're cold emailing. Twitter, Google, Yelp, Facebook, and other user-driven sites are ideal for pinpointing a problem your recipient may be struggling with.\nAgitate Now that you've identified the problem, poke at it a little. Try and evoke an emotional response from the reader by reinforcing why their problem is so frustrating.\nSolve Offer a solution to the problem. The goal is to convince the reader that your product/service is a no-brainer solution that makes all their problems go away. Make sure this section includes a clear and low- commitment CTA.\nThe template below is designed for a salesperson selling a CRM solution, but it can be easily modified for other products.\nTemplate - Hi {first name},\nAI Messager\n7\nI've noticed some negative reviews about your customer service. Citing lost tickets, lack of tools, and disorganization. Isʼt this frustrating ?\nProduct name} integrates all customer data. You can easily track, manage, and measure customer interactions.\nWould you like to hear more about how {product name} can turn those negative reviews into loyal, satisfied customers?\nEnding\nWhy Does this work ?\nThe opening line of this email example is personalized and shows the reader youʼve done your research. More importantly, pointing out a flaw or problem your reader has is highly motivating. They donʼt want others to know their companyʼs weaknesses, which is why the PAS formula has such a high response rate. Your reader will be desperate to fix the problem, and theyʼll have an easy solution right in front of them.\nWhen to use it ?\nMake sure youʼve done your research before using a PAS email. Itʼs most effective once youʼve clearly identified a prospectʼs pain point to which you can offer a no-brainer solution in response.\nThe “AIDAˮ cold email template\nSocial proof, data, and intrigue are what make the AIDA (attention, interest, desire, action) formula successful. Itʼs kind of like being that friend who talks to you after a rough day at work and says, “Hey, I totally get it.ˮ\nLetʼs look at an example of a cold email using the AIDA template backed by real data.\nAI Messager\n8\nTemplate -\nHi {first name}, What if a {product/service} could help you {solve a problem} ?\nIn one year's time, we helped {company name] achieve a % increase in sales after implementing your {product name}.\nIn addition to an increase in sales, {your product name} helped {company name} improve their overall workflow, increase efficiency, reduce response rate time, and improve customer satisfaction from A% to B%.\nI'd love to talk to you about how your product name could help your company increase sales and improve workflow. Do you have time to connect this week?\nWhy Does this work ?\nThe data and social proof you provide in your message should be relevant to your cold email prospect. If your prospect is part of a company that sells SEO metrics software, for example, your use case should reflect a similar brand model.\nThe opening line should intrigue your lead with a thought-provoking and attractive scenario (attention). The second line is designed to keep the reader interested by offering a tidbit of social proof or data that supports your opening statement (interest).\nNext, pique your lead's desire by offering even more social proof (desire). The \"attention.\" \"interest.\" and \"desire\" parts of AIDA will keep your reader hooked throughout the email. After you get your reader to say, \"Okay, I'm convinced.\" the last piece of the formula (action) should address the question \"What do I do next?\"\nWhen to use it ?\nUse the AIDA approach when your cold email prospect represents a data-\nAI Messager\n9\ndriven brand because they'll be interested in the data and social proof. Find out what's important to your prospect on a professional level. If your product or service is a match for that\nprospect, presenting attractive data from a successful use case will motivate your reader to respond.\nThe “straight to businessˮ cold email template\nSometimes the direct approach is the best approach. This is especially true for busy executives and no-nonsense brands. Get right to the point by identifying a scenario or problem common to your prospect. Without any added fluff, present the reader with concrete data that proves your product or service is the logical solution.\nWhile the template below is specific to a CRM solution, it can be tweaked for any type of organization.\nTemplate -\nHi {first name}, Is your customer support system actually losing you money?\nWeʼve helped large companies like yours lower support costs by {x%} and improve overall sales by {xy%} in less than a year.\nAll we did was integrate their entire company-wide support system into one efficient, easy-to-manage workflow called {product/service name}.\nItʼs quick and easy to set up and requires no onboarding at all. Do you have time this week to discuss how {product/service name} could boost your sales?\nWhy Does this work ?\nAI Messager\n10\nThe opening line is the perfect intro hook for a busy prospect: short, attention-grabbing, and engaging.\nIn this case, the cold email caters specifically to the no-nonsense mind of your prospect. You get straight to the point, provide proof, and leave your prospect with a low-commitment CTA that fits their schedule.\nWhen to use it ?\nThis approach is highly effective for eliciting responses from busy professionals with flooded inboxes. It quickly answers the question, “Whatʼs in it for me?ˮ and provides proof to back it up.\nThe “paint a pictureˮ cold email template\nThis cold email is all about getting your potential prospect to visualize how sweet life could be with your product or service.\nConvince a prospect that your product or service will directly improve their world by showing them what their life currently looks like without it. Make sure whatever scenario you present is realistic to your prospect.\nNext, paint a picture of that same scenario, only this time with your product or service. Whatʼs changed? How has your solution made their life so much better?\nTemplate-\nHi {first name},\nNothing is more frustrating than losing a great candidate because you canʼt find their resume, interview history, or contact information.\nImagine a world where all of that information is organized in one simple, easy-to-find place. Product/service name} is that place.\nDo you have time this week for a quick demo to see how it works? {insert email signature here}\nWhy Does this work ?\nThe “paint a pictureˮ cold sales email template is a shortcut to getting your prospect to convert as quickly as possible. If they can envision a better, easier, or more productive life with your product or service, theyʼll only have one question left: “Where do I sign up?ˮ. For very well envisionble things, this is great. Can also be used in mixture with the other templates.\nWhen to use it ?\nCold emails are only effective if the product or service youʼre presenting makes sense to the reader. They need to know how it will directly benefit them.\nSome people may have a harder time understanding how your product or service works in a practical sense. This cold email answers that question with a real-world example that every brand should have in its arsenal.\nSome Frameworks - How to Use These Frameworks\nEach framework is built for designated use cases. This helps identify where theyʼll be the most effective for you. We include examples for each framework, but these are not meant to be copy and pasted. They only contain light personalization, so the framework bones are clear.

Try it today for free.\nThe Mouse Trap Use case: First touch, DM, Follow-up How to use it: The Mouse Trap contains two steps. And itʼs a one or two-sentence email. 1. Observation 2. Question\nAn observation is the context for why youʼre showing up in their inbox. The question should be value-prop driven, meaning the value you add. It focuses on a challenge and implies your product or service has the solution.\nThe question should be binary (meaning it can be answered with a yes or no), and it doesnʼt explicitly state what you do. The question is phrased so it implies what you do.\nExample:\nWill, looks like you're hiring reps.\nWould it be helpful to get a more granular look at how they're ramping up on email?\nWhy it works: The mouse trap drives an impulsive reply based on curiosity. Itʼs a priority check. If what youʼre mentioning is a priority for your prospect, youʼre likely to get a quick response.\nItʼs a helpful framework to use when you have high-intent signals or are in demand capture mode.\nThe Mouse Trap with Context Use case: First touch, DM, Follow-up\nAI Messager\n12\nHow to use it:\n1. Observation 2. Question 3. Context\nThis is the same as The Mouse Trap, but also includes context for what you do. You want to hit on an implied solution to the challenge. Youʼre providing a little more background information for why youʼre reaching out.\nExample:\nWill, looks like you're hiring reps.\nWould it be helpful to get a more granular look at how they're ramping on email? Our in-inbox email coach, Lavender, helps teams ramp faster.\nWhy it works: Youʼre taking The Mouse Trap and adding how you can help your reader if the suggested problem is present. This added detail can bring them closer to understanding the purpose of your question.\nItʼs still short and direct, which is why it also works as a direct message DM or as a bump (a follow-up email).\nVanilla Ice Cream\nUse case: First touch\nHow to use it:\n1. Make an observation: One sentence that shows you know your reader. Use your personalization research.\n2. Share a problem or insight: One relevant sentence that implies a pain point or value prop. It should be related to your observation.\n3. Build credibility: Speak to the challenge youʼre solving and how youʼve helped solve this for other customers.\n4. Share a solution: Explain what you did to solve this problem in one sentence.\n5. Call-to-conversation CTC End with a question or interest-based CTA (call to action). Your primary goal is to start a conversation.\nExample:\nGeorge,\nAI Messager\n13\nAI Messager\n14\nI saw you're hiring SDRs. I imagine you're thinking about how they'll ramp. Usually, our customers focus on cold calls. But their email results lag.\nWe're helping reps at Sendoso ramp faster. They continue to improve each quarter with our in-inbox coach.\nWorth a chat? Will\nWhy this works: The first part of the email creates logic and clarity for why youʼre reaching out. Making an informed conclusion from an observation shows you understand the situation they may be in. This builds credibility.\nThe second half gives the email purpose. It establishes the context and illustrates to the reader that you know them.\nAnd lastly, think of your prospecting as growing a plant. In order to grow, a plant needs nurturing and the right conditions. Similarly, with your first touch, you're planting a seed and beginning to build rapport.\nSo donʼt pitch your product at this point. Your aim is to get a reply, not book a meeting (yet). Booking a meeting and closing a deal will come after you get a positive reply. So focus there first!\nWe call this one Vanilla Ice Cream because itʼs foundational. Like a delicious sundae may have a vanilla ice cream base, this framework is the base for your fantastic emails.\n2x your reply rates with Lavender\nNeutral Insights Use case: Follow up, LinkedIn DMs, nurture or re-engagement How to use it:\n1. Reference a third-party resource: Bring a trusted, third-party publication to the discussion. Share the piece you want your reader to see, and show that youʼre being neutral. Do not use your companyʼs blog or other branded resources.\n2. Explain why they should read it: Reuse your context for reaching out and start a conversation with this question.\nAI Messager\n15\n3. Explain why youʼre sharing it: Tie your “whyˮ to your understanding of their situation and their business needs, wants, and goals.\n4. Optional: Make a soft ask and nod back to the original CTA or, ideally, CTC.\nExample:\nGeorge, do you read Outreachʼs blog? Given you're likely ramping reps, I thought you'd find it interesting.\nThe VP of Sales Dev at Segment wrote about how she scaled her team to a $3.2B acquisition.\nThey did it without using canned templates (and using Lavender! Check it out Will P.S. Any thoughts on my last note?\nWhy this works: Your reader knows youʼre trying to sell something. Most people send their own branded content. However, your companyʼs content tends to be biased — at least, thatʼs your buyerʼs perception.\nBy sending them a third-party resource, youʼre breaking a pattern. Youʼre building trust on common, neutral ground. This approach creates a sense of safety. And it also keeps your reader engaged.\nSending relevant content that could help your reader builds connection as a trusted resource. And thatʼs a prerequisite for any next steps.\nThe Thoughtful Bump Use case: Follow up How to use it: Context  Bump\nThis email should be one to three sentences. First, ask if your reader had thoughts on your previous message. Explain youʼre curious because of the original reason you reached out. End with a simple question.\nExample:\nHey George,\nAI Messager\n16\nGiven that you're growing the sales team, I thought this would be worth discussing.\nDid you have any feedback on my note? Will\nWhy it works: With this framework, youʼre still seeking to start a conversation. Youʼre being thoughtful by providing context for why you are reaching out. Youʼre showing youʼve considered their time and value their attention by asking a casual question in this “bumpˮ format.\nGenuine curiosity can both hook the reader and ensure youʼre being human in your approach.\nThe Clarification Use case: Follow up How to use it: Rephrase The Vanilla Ice Cream framework with these changes: 1. Restate the context for why youʼre reaching out\n2. Seek to clarify part 1 \"What we do\"\n3. Seek to clarify part 2 \"Why that's relevantˮ\n4. Call-to-conversation CTC\nExample:\nHey George,\nGiven you're growing the sales team, I thought coaching might be top of mind.\nTo clarify, we've built a sales email coach. Sits right inside their inbox.\nHigh-growth teams like Twilio get great results (and peace of mind). Plus, you get a better sense of what reps are sending without hovering over their shoulder.\nThink this could help your team? Will\nWhy it works: This is another version of a Thoughtful Bump. It rephrases the original first-touch framework.\nAI Messager\n17\nThe added context gives you a shot to clarify exactly where your solution applies to their challenge. This email is not a place to feature dump. Instead, itʼs an opportunity to explain how your solution fits into their life. It makes things concrete for the reader.\nIf an email is too focused on you or your company, itʼs not a great cold email. But itʼs a great follow-up email because youʼve already introduced the problem into their mind, and now youʼre providing clarity on how you can give them a solution.\nThe Well-Researched Referral Use case: Follow Up How to use it: 1. Start with who (namedrop early)\n2. Ask if they're a better person for the topic\n3. Explain why they might be a better person.\n4. Explain why you reached out in the first place.\nExample:\nHey Will,\nWould Jen be a better person to talk to about this webinar?\nRealize she manages community activity. Given the event is going to be all sellers, I thought you'd want the exposure.\nWill\nWhy it works: When you havenʼt heard back, or you receive a “not interested,ˮ this framework can be a powerful tool. At this stage, youʼre not selling; youʼre soliciting. The key is to be well-researched. Otherwise, your reader will see right through it.\nDo your research, and donʼt just drop a name — have a reason for why this other person could be the better one to connect with. Example: Plug this new personʼs experience, or mention the roles and responsibilities from their LinkedIn description.\nYou can also try this as a P.S. in your follow-up email. Our data shows that a P.S. on a personalized note can net 35% more replies.\nAdding something like, “P.S. If this is something Jen is handling, I can reach out to herˮ can be an effective way to drive that referral forward.\nPro tip: Donʼt dump the same email on two people at the same company simultaneously. They are very likely to backchannel to each other. If they find youʼre sending the same email to multiple people, theyʼre unlikely to respond positively.\nThis approach can also cause deliverability issues. You might get flagged for spamming or, if done too often, blacklisted.\nThe Breakup Use case: Objection, breakup/final email How to use it: 1. State that you've reached out 2. Explain why you did 3. Assume the timing is off 4. Ask them to correct you 5. Clarify it's the last email Example: Hey George, I've reached out a few times because youʼre hiring so many new reps. I thought our email coach could help.\nAI Messager\n18\nAI Messager\n19\nI'm going to chalk it up to my timing being off. Let me know if I'm wrong, but I'll stop my outreach for now. Do you think this will be a priority in the next two quarters?\nWhy it works: Remember itʼs not a breakup forever; itʼs a “bye for now.ˮ Youʼre not saying youʼll never talk to them again. But if youʼve sent a few notes and havenʼt heard back, ask if you “missed the markˮ and try to get them to correct you. People love to correct others.\nThe Competitor\n(or Complementary Tech) Use case: First touch How to use it: 1. Acknowledge the competitor 2. Ask if they're happy with it 3. Compliment the competitor 4. Highlight the competitor's shortcomings 5. Open up a dialogue with a question related to #4 Example:\nHey Will, Saw you're using Drift for chat. How are you liking it?\nI know their product is killer for lead gen. However, most of their customers switch to us because they need more functionality for customer support.\nCould you see chat playing a factor in reducing churn?\nWhy this works: Discussing the competitor's shortcomings helps reframe your readerʼs point of view. Notice how the exampleʼs second and third sentence reframes, establishes credibility, and creates a bridge to the next point. This can be an opportunity to get specific and build personalization.\nYouʼre seeking to get a deeper understanding during the fifth step. If someoneʼs primary concern is the competitorʼs strength, itʼs hard to change their mind. You need to know more. This deeper understanding can also help you prioritize your time on deals.\nAI Messager\n20\nWhile you should avoid badmouthing your competition, it can be useful to highlight your strengths.\nPro tip: Tie the differences you highlight to your readerʼs situation and problems.\nThe Video\nUse case: Prospecting (but never in a first touch)\nHow to use it:\n1. Observation (to give context)\n2. Tie the observation to their challenge\nA video should never be your first touch. It gives the reader extra work and can hurt your chances of delivery.\nThe video also canʼt stand alone. You need to give your prospect an idea of whatʼs in the video and compel them to want to watch it.\nAs a seller, you must put yourself in a decision makerʼs shoes. Theyʼre in meetings and calls all day. They simply canʼt watch your video (or listen to your audio message) during a meeting. An email is much easier to read when theyʼre multitasking.\nSome buyers will never watch your video. Others love to receive them. Itʼs important to test multiple formats and channels on each buyer. But never start off with a video because itʼs unlikely to be watched or responded to. First, build familiarity via text.\nExample:\nHey Will,\nGiven your team is growing, I thought you'd find this interesting. Growth typically either leads to one of two things: trying to standardize or risking having no idea whatʼs working across inboxes.\nAssuming youʼre personalizing emails, thought you might enjoy this: [insert video here]\nIf so, worth a chat soon?\nWhy this works: When youʼre sending a video, your only goal is a video play. Like other frameworks, you need to start with context and connect it\nto a potential problem your prospect is facing. This is a common theme because selling is about solving your buyer's pain.\nFinally, end with an ask to continue the conversation. Here are other powerful ways to incorporate video in your emails.\nThe DM\nUse case: LinkedIn InMail / DM (or other social platforms)\nHow to use it:\n1. Give context on what prompted you to reach out\n2. Tie that observation back to an insight or challenge they have\n3. Ask a question that either ties the original context to the question or the challenge to a different observation about them or their business\nExample:\nHey Emily,\nGreat to see the traction on your hiring post. For SDR ramp, Iʼm seeing a lot of sales leaders leaning on phone training and email templates.Do you have a playbook from your time with Salesforce?\nWill\nWhy it works: Social inboxes arenʼt email inboxes. Itʼs a water cooler. Not a to-do list. This framework takes best practices from email and applies them to social.\nYouʼll notice itʼs shorter and focused on starting a controlled dialogue where you can naturally introduce what you do. It pulls in personalization at the bottom of the message (not just the top).\nSeek to start a conversation: Try to give the reader context on why youʼre showing up in their DMs.\nHere are a few other tips and tactics to remember when crafting your next LinkedIn InMail or other social media DM.\nFounder Card Use case: Founder-led sales, Entering a new market, Launching a new\nproduct\nHow to use it:\nAI Messager\n21\n1. Start with a problem and a benign goal\n2. State that youʼre looking for feedback\n3. Say what you do and establish credibility\n4. Share what you want feedback on and ask if they're open to the conversation\nExample:\nWill, is anything frustrating you with your email analytics?\nI ask because I'm looking for feedback. I run Lavender. It's a real-time sales email coach. We help sellers at orgs like Sendoso, Twilio, Clari, etc.\nWe're currently building out cadences and personalization analytics. Are you open to sharing how we could build it to solve your problems? Talk soon.\nWhy it works: This framework can set you up to get feedback and find product market fit. People will likely give you helpful feedback if you've hit the mark with the problem.\nThis only works if youʼre clear on why you want their feedback and think it can help them. Youʼre telling your reader you have influence in the company, and you can make the product fit their specific needs.\nToe Dip\nUse case: Conversation starter\nHow to use it:\n1. Observation\n2. Interest-based CTC (call-to-conversation)\nExample:\nLooks like you're hiring reps, Will.\nSales leaders with growing teams usually lean on templates to coach email writing.\nDoes that sound similar to what you're doing at Lavender?\nWhy it works: All first-touch emails seek to start a conversation. But this is a simple and brief way to do that.\nAI Messager\n22\nAI Messager\n23\nRe-Engage 3 Ways Use case: Re-engage old accounts How to use it: We have three different approaches that are effective for re-engagement.\nA common theme youʼll see in each framework is using unsure tones. Because youʼre showing up in your buyerʼs inbox again and attempting to revive a convo, everything you say should be assumption-free.\n1. One sentence re-engagement email:\nIs XYZ still a priority? Is challenge still a priority? Are you still working on <initiative to achieve outcome>? Last we spoke X problem] was a focus. Is that still top of mind?\nWhy this works: Itʼs important to be mindful of how much time youʼre requesting from your recipient. Especially when youʼre attempting to re- engage and have shown up in their inbox. Thatʼs why a one-sentence email can be highly effective.\nThis approach helps you get to the point with a straightforward question. Because itʼs brief and conversational, they may be more likely to respond with a simple answer, giving you something to work with for a follow-up.\nPS. This approach is also great for when youʼve been ghosted (not only for re-engagement).\n2. The “We've got something newˮ angle\nRemind your recipient of context from previous conversations (in one sentence).\nUpdate them about what's new since you spoke. This should be something that could help them achieve the outcome they said they were interested in.\nAsk if it's worth re-engaging.\nExample:\nHey Meagan, Last we spoke, personalization was a big focus for your reps.\nNot sure if that's still the case, but we made some great updates to our personalization assistant. Itʼs now 10x faster.\nThink this could help? Or is this no longer a focus?\nWhy this works: First, youʼre restating something familiar from a previous conversation. Hopefully, this triggers a memory for them; at the least, youʼre reinforcing your thoughtfulness.\nYouʼre then directly connecting a product update to their need. This may or may not be enough for them to have interest, but youʼre closing with the open ask. Youʼre simply seeking to start a conversation (again) and not assuming itʼs of interest.\n3. New updates on their end:\nRemind your recipient of context from previous conversations (in one sentence).\nState what you've observed change. Remember to be tentative, donʼt make assumptions.)\nShare how you think priorities may have changed and how your company aligns.\nConfirm if your hypothesis is accurate.\nExample:\nHey Sam, Last time we spoke, getting your AEs to prospect was a big focus.\nNow that you're hiring SDRs, I wonder if that means the AEs werenʼt successful?\nOur dashboards can help you get ahead of these coachable moments. Itʼll give you data on writing time, content analytics, where to improve, personalization, etc.\nAm I off in thinking you'd like a deeper sense of what's working in your email efforts?\nWhy this works: This is similar to the last approach. However, here youʼre making a connection between a change or update in their company and how you might be able to help.\nAI Messager\n24\nAI Messager\n25\nItʼs easy to be off-base when making an observation, so using unsure tones is critical. Best case, your observation lands correctly. Worst case, they set you straight, and you have a reply to work with.\nExec-to-Exec\nUse case: Late-stage deal or when youʼve been ghosted\nHow to use it:\nExecutives donʼt have a lot of time. This email should be short and direct.\n1. Explain why youʼre showing up in their inbox.\n2. Reinforce that your team is aligned on the problem you aim to solve for the recipient.\n3. Close by offering your support.\nExample:\nJen,\nI understand youʼve been working with Ashley on our team in hopes Lavender can solve your challenge with diving reply rates.\nIs there anything we can do to assist you here? Cheers, Will\nWhy it works: Think of this framework as a nudge. Sometimes, all it takes is someone with a similar title as your decision-maker to help move the conversation. Thereʼs no ask happening here. By showing up and simply offering to help, youʼre creating a connection with another stakeholder with zero pressure.\nThe Customer Mirror How to use it: 1. Start with an observation. Avoid any “I sawˮ or “I noticedˮ narratives.\n2. Tie the observation to a similar situation. This is where you loop in your customer. The customerʼs similarity is your reason for reaching out. Make sure you know who youʼre reaching out to.\n3. Offer a challenge faced by that customer. Youʼre creating relatability.\nAI Messager\n26\n4. Explain how the customer approached the challenge. Explain how they were dealing with the problem. Nail these two sections of copy and watch your reply rates .\n5. Ask if theyʼre seeing a similar situation. Great opportunity to either sandwich the email with new personalization or reuse your original observation.\nPro tip: Bringing in something new? Use their work experience. Shapes their perspective.\nExample:\nYour team is off to the races, Will.\nCurious if this sounds familiar. With the round, and your time at [company], it reminds me of our customer [name].\nBig round. New faces. Team knew personalization was working in outbound. But scale was tricky. They lost sight of what was working.\nPersonalization is big at [company name], no? Curious if this is a challenge for you too?\nWhy it works: Thereʼs no pitch involved in this email. Itʼs nothing more than sharing a story your buyer can relate to.\nWe donʼt want to overwhelm the reader. Itʼs already a longer framework. Save the finale for a follow-up. See our follow-up frameworks above. :)\nSocial Proof\nIf possible Offer some social proof. Add a couple of customer reviews, testimonials, and case studies from some of your former clients. If you have an online profile, you can also direct prospects to some of your best work. This is a great way to show them that youʼre a professional who knows what they are doing.\nTailor the message to the recipient , Validating you in relation to them-\n📈\nPersonalization means that youʼve thought about who this person is, how they see the world, what interests them, and what they want — youʼve developed a “theory of mindˮ about the recipient. This shows them you have put work into understanding them.\nYou also make it clear why you are emailing them as opposed to anyone else. Research shows that people are far more motivated to help others when they feel uniquely qualified to do so. By outlining precisely where they fit in, you can tell a story that makes sense to them.\nIf possible, Validate yourself. When we meet a stranger or get an email from one, we want to know who that person is and why that person matters to us.\nRemember that when youʼre the stranger. Youʼve already done a bunch of research on the people youʼre emailing, but they donʼt know anything about you. You need to show them youʼre credible and they can trust you.\nKnowing someone in common is the strongest form of social proof you can offer. If you have any direct connections, mention them. A mutual friend means you are no longer a stranger.\nLacking that, if you have any authority, credibility, or social status that is relevant to this person and your request, mention it quickly — a line or two should do it. The more “importantˮ you are, the more likely you are to get a response.\nIf you have no real status, thatʼs fine. Find a commonality. Being part of the same group, especially if itʼs a personal group, is a core human attraction. Look for unexpected connections, like hometowns and unusual hobbies. As Adam Grant points out, “Similarities matter most when theyʼre rare. We bond when we share uncommon commonalities, which allow us to feel that we fit in and stand out at the same time.ˮ\nThe point is, you want to find a way to go from “strangerˮ to part of the recipientʼs group\nCTA\nAI Messager\n27\nEvery email has a purpose, whether thatʼs asking for information, calling for a click, or asking for a reply Or asking them to share more info or any Clear action which will result in the person replying and potentially buying what you sell. Getting the right call to action is critical for a successful cold email campaign.\nEnd your cold email with a call-to-action\nYouʼre almost done. You just need to write a call to action CTA that will persuade your prospects to do what you ultimately want them to do with your cold email. It may be scheduling a Zoom conversation, giving you feedback, replying to you, etc. Anything youʼre ready to take care of. Any action you ultimately want them to perform. Keep it simple and straightforward.\nTo make sure your recipients will take action, your CTA should:\nExpress the purpose of your email – the CTA should clarify the aim of your email in a single sentence. To put it differently, it should clearly show the addressee what you want them to do.\nBe short and to-the-point – the CTA shouldnʼt take more than a single sentence. You should be as succinct as you can. It shouldnʼt be blurry either\nHow to craft a Subject ?\nThe Subject has to very minimal words. 3 or 4 words is ideal.\nA cold email subject line could be seen as the key that unlocks the door to our message. Our prospects form their first impression of us while reading the subject line. Thatʼs why we need to make it a good one.\nA poorly written subject line may make the addressee biased against us and our email. They might decide not to open the email, or worse, manually mark it as spam which may cause problems with email deliverability.\nWe can avoid such situations so long as we stick to these rules:\nAI Messager\n28\nAI Messager\n29\nconsider your prospect‘s point of view – think what kind of benefit your subject line promises to the prospect. Whatʼs in it for them after opening your email? Does it answer their needs or appeals to their curiosity? Make it about them, not about you.\npersonalize it – again, the subject line isnʼt a place for self-promotion. Quite the opposite, itʼs a place where you should prove to the addressee that you carefully planned to contact them. You should assure them youʼre not a spammer who sends tons of identical emails to people and waits to see what sticks.\nintrigue them – donʼt spill the beans just yet. Pique their interest. Engage their attention by making them reflect on a problem they may have. Or try using a little bit of flattery to catch their attention.\nsound human – youʼre writing to a living and breathing human being, and thus, you shouldnʼt turn into a bot. Avoid sounding ‘salesyʼ or too formal. Your subject line should have a casual, friendly and natural flair to it. Unless you know how to achieve this, try imagining youʼre addressing a specific person you know, for example, your colleague.\ntie it to the rest of the email – this relates to the earlier points discussed. Itʼs crucial to ensure that your subject line aligns with the content of your message. Avoid resorting to clickbait strategies in your subject line, as they will only irritate your prospects and negatively impact your outreach efforts.\nAvoid Cliches and jargon\nPeople tend to sift through emails and this cliches like “Found that “ and “Strategicˮ . Remove cliches like ˮHope this email finds you well “ ˮInnovativeˮ AI Recruiter . Remove “Comprehensiveˮ . Reduce # of syllables in words/sentences/paragraphs. Simpler emails tend to get more replies.\nPersonalisation\nAI Messager\n30\nOne idea rule of emails . Max 2. The one-idea rule is this:\nOne idea per email One idea per paragraph One idea per sentence\nThe one-idea rule makes it easy to write clearly. And clarity is the primary focus when writing emails.\nCommas conjoin ideas. They break the one-idea rule. And if your sentence is long enough to require a breath (a comma), it's likely too long and unclear for email. If you're using a comma, the two ideas can likely exist as two individual sentences. Writing this way might seem too simple or too choppy. If it does, you're right on track.\nThis is because people don't read emails. They skim them. Litmus research shows that users spend an average of 9 seconds with your emails. Short, choppy sentences are easier to skim.\nOptimised Email -\nYou have to optimise the earlier draft on two things - 1. Remember to output as small an email as possible . Cut down words , Cut down unnecessary descriptions and cliches , Cut down words which are not necessary. At max should have 80 words.\n Can you also make it so simple that an 4th grader can understand.\nHere, you can still talk about the details etc. However, the logic and value and problems etc should be conveyed in very simple framing. 3.

It also stitched in a relevant customer reference very well Testimonials are killing right now according to the data) I wasn't anywhere close to evaluating G2. But, it started a conversation. It got me to consider where this fits.\nAI Messager\n37\nIt didn't \"capture\" existing demand It created it.\n###########\nExample  7 Hey Will,\nIʼm a big fan of vour winked in content and vour merch is chet's kiss right on time.\nThis time of year can be a huge grind for E-commerce businesses, considering all of preparation required to make Black Endav. voer Monday, and December ho davs as successtulas possible.\nCurious to know how you're handling tultillment for your online store, traveling for sales training events, creating content, and being a father and mentor. SERIOUSLY, How are you doing all of this?\nIʼm at warehouse inc , We're a bestein-class 3P wth a broad network of fulfillment centers.\nThink it would make sense to connect? Best , Luc\nExpert Opinion -\nHere's the best email I've received in H2 It's not perfect but does a lot of things right:\nVery personalized, got my attention and made me feel special, talking about my merch made sense in the context of why they reached out\nKinda hits on a problem (fulfillment is a pain)\nClosed CTA What could be better:\nAI Messager\n38\nI'd argue it's TOO personalized, this email must've taken 20-minutes to write because they would've had to have looked at my LinkedIn AND Instagram to get all this info. I doubt I'd be a huge client for them so is that time well spent?\nThey could spot I have a new merch store & hold multiple roles in less than 5-minutes, that's probably enough to hypothesize that I'm a busy dude and don't like doing fulfillment.\nThe problem isn't super clear, I have to assume they're saying \"fulfillment is a pain, we can help with that\"\nThe solution is a bit buzz-wordy, I don't know what 3PL is and don't really care\nHere's a rewrite that could've been less personalized but still nailed it:\n\"Hey Will,\nYour new merch store looks incredible. Love the branding.\nBased on the fact you're also a dad, trainer, speaker, and full time employee at Lavender  I imagine you dread doing shipping for your store.\nOther ecommerce owners have found they can reduce involvement by letting us take over their fulfillment.\nBonus  The shipping costs & time for customers is better too!\nSound interesting?\nCheers,\n(optional) P.S. It took everything in me not to write \"I hope this email finds you well\" in this email, luckily your hoodies have me covered \"\nBooked the meeting either way, well done Luc.\n########### Example  8\nHey Chris  I saw you attended Salesfinity's live cold calling event.\nIf vour team is evaluating power dialers to guarantee more calls connections and conversations, Kixie could be a great fit.\n😉\nAI Messager\n39\nKixie's mistiline dialer with SeAM protection natively integrates with rubspot and Salestorce, helping you crush cold calling and eliminate busy work between calls.\nHereʼs my offer :\n1. Put at least one rep on a Kixie trial for free for one week 2. If his/her number of calls and pickup rate don't increase, Chipotle on me (quac and double chicken)\nGame on?\nExpert Opinion -\nShoutout to Roy Lieberman at Kixie for an awesome email. \"i will buy you chipotle\" is a great subject, definitely piques my curiosity (even though we don't have Chipotle in Quebec) Starts with a reference to the Linked live event and then makes an assumption from there about power dialers. This is a touch risky, since, I register for a bunch of Linkedin lives and don't always attend them, but I was at this one for a bit. Finally - the \"piece de resistance\" - putting your money where your mouth is and offering up a free trial to SHOW the possible results of the tool. The ironic part is I have no interest in a power dialer right now, nor do I have Chipotle in my area, but I still loved the message. Great job Roy. Fun. Creative. Different"
